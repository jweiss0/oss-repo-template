### Gitstats-Generated Data
#### Project 16: Anchor
Gitstats found only 4682 lines of code, while the hand-recorded data showed 4669 lines of code. Besides this, the rest of the information was the same.
#### Project 17: Angel-Framework
Gitstats found only 213 lines of code, while the hand-recorded data showed 784 lines of code. It also found 4 contributors instead of only 2. This was because of inconsistencies in the usernames of contributors.
#### Project 18: Animate.css
Gitstats found 3918 lines of code, while the hand-recorded data showed 3916 lines of code. It also found 79 contributors instead of only 1. This is most likely because the RCOS project was the fork of a much larger Animate.css project.
#### Project 19: AntiMoz
Gitstats found 1829 lines of code, while the hand-reccorded data showed 1927 lines of code. It also found 6 contributors instead of only 2. Again, I believe this was because of inconsistencies in the usernames/emails of contributors.
#### Project 20: ARAS
Gitstats found 2919 lines of code, while the hand-recorded data showed 56794 lines of code. It also found 2 contributors instead of only 1. It seems that there were significant discrepancies between the hand-recorded data and the Gitstats data for this project.
