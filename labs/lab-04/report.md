### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
For an open source project, choosing a license is necessary to allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. Without one, there is much ambiguity regarding how a creator would like to share their work. Without proper permission given through a license, there is no formal binding agreement between a developer and a creator, meaning one cannot reap the full benefits of a software being "open source". This includes being able to use a software, modify a software, and redistribute the software in a manner that the original creator allows.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
As mentioned previously, without a proper license, there is much ambiguity regarding how a creator would like to share their work. The creator may consider their work copyrighted. If the creator doesn't provide explicit rights to modify, distribute, or even use the project, you could be at risk of a lawsuit. Even if a creator allows you to modify their work without a license, there is no license in place to protect the modified work that you completed.

### Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher
I agree with the claim presented by the article, which is that "developers should release their software to the public early in the process in order to gain adherents and then let a larger development community make improvements to the code", rather than a single team handling all features and innovations. By releasing software early, it allows for more scrutiny of a project, leading to a more involved community. If a project's decisions are handled solely by the creators, without any input from the community, there will be less widespread support and less community contributions as a direct result. Since the Gopher project had waited too long to allow the community to aid in decisions and significant contributions for the project, the community (and thus the project itself) was negatively affected.

### Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source
Microsoft chose to use the MIT License for its .NET Core. The MIT License allows for commercial use, distribution, modification, and private use. It also requires that a copy of the license and copyright notice are included with the licensed material. On November 12th, 2014, Microsoft announced that .NET would be open sourced under the MIT license ([1](https://tirania.org/blog/archive/2014/Nov-12.html)). This license was chosen because it is very permissive. It follows Microsoft's effort to open source many of their projects, including C# and Visual Basic, Visual F# Tools, ASP.NET 5, and the Entity Framework. There were two main reasons for open sourcing the .NET Core project, highlighted by Immo Landwerth, a program manager on the .NET Framework team. The first reason was to "lay the foundation for a cross platform .NET", meaning Microsoft essentially wanted a more effective way to rebuild the cross-platform .NET code base. The second reason was to "build and leverage a stronger ecosystem", meaning Microsoft wanted a way to build a better and more supportive community around the project ([2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/)). The main goal of the project, as mentioned previously, is to more effectively rewrite a cross-platform version of the .NET Framework. The MIT License best allows for this, since it is very simple with nearly no restrictions, making it extremely easy to contribute to the project.

### Open Source Project and Business Model
*Table 1* \
Our project idea is an inventory manager. It is open source, but hosting, storage, and customizability are charged for.\
The license that best fits our business model is the GNU General Public License v3.0.\
The repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/aidan-lane/oss-lab04).
