#### Suggestions for `How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way`
- Don't try to use "fancy" technical language if you don't know what it means. Write your question in a way you will understand the content, which will make is easier for someone to reply in a way you understand. It could also make it easier for other beginners to learn from the same question/response.
- Don't assume that just because a question doesn't use the same exact software or hardware specifications as you, it isn't helpful. Commonly, you'll find that questions/responses involving something such as a similar library or an older tool version will provide plenty of information to bring you closer to resolving an issue on your own.

#### Free Culture Chapter 3
Chapter 3 of Free Culture discusses the case of Jesse Jordan, an RPI alum, who was sued by the Recording Industry Association
of America for innocently tinkering with openly available technology. He had worked to build a search engine to index files made public by those on the RPI network. This had been created not with malicious intent, but rather out of curiosity. Although Jesse had no control over the content displayed on his search engine, the RIAA thought it would be a great idea to sue an innocent college student. Jesse simply improved upon existing software, making it more usable, yet he was seemingly penalized for it. Reading this chapter has made me think about all the times I've explored side projects out of pure curiosity, yet how easily I could've been in a similar situation to Jesse. This is only one specific example, but there are most likely other examples that exist of this occurring to other developers. If this was a more commonly known occurence, it would be even more evident that big media companies have the capacity to undermine the creative nature of harmless projects involving technology being used in new and unique ways.

## 6. Reflection
One open source project I have come across that may be interesting to evalulate is VLC Media Player, or VideoLAN Client Media Player. I came across this by thinking about open source projects I've used and also searching for lists of open source projects. VLC Media Player is such a widely used application that supports multiple platforms. I would consider it to be a successful open source project, which is why I think it would be interesting to analyze. Another open source project I came across was ZeroMQ, which I found on The Architecture of Open Source Applications website. I've seen this project used in production, so it also sparked my interest. I plan to continue looking through open source applications or libraries that I personally use, as well as browsing online sources to figure out other possible open source projects to analyze.
